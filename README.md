### Hello!

My name is Justin Chen, I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology.
I am an aspiring front end developer and app creator, one day I hope to put one of my apps on the front page of the app store!
Before then I am just trying my best to learn the skills necessary to achieve my goals while balancing school work and social life.

Here is my web portfolio if you are interested in seeing some of my projects!
